### By Khyatee Desai

# Introduction
This project explores text preprocessing, stopword removal, lexicon normalization, frequency distribution, part-of-speech analysis, sentiment analysis, vectorization, feature engineering and classification modeling of music reviews published on Pitchfork

# Data
The dataset for this project comes from a Kaggle collection of[song reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data) published on Pitchfork.com. The data is stored as a collection of tables within a Sqlite database.

- join relevant tables
- create the target variable: "good" reviews (scored above 8.0,) and "bad" reviews (scored below 6.0)
- remove stopwords and punctuation
- identify language using langdetect
- stemm and lemmatize
